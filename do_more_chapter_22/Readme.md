# Chapter 22: Changing Environment Variables (export)

## Do More

### Take and list out all the environment variables you've found and then go look up what they are online (please do 5-10 or so).

    $LANG - stores the value in the language that the user understands
    $HOME - default path to the user's home directory
    $EDITOR - path to the program which edits the content of files
    $USER - the username
    $UID - user's unique ID
    $TERM - default terminal emulator
    $SHELL - shell being used by the user
     

### Read the man page for env again. What else can it do?

  It displays all the environment variables. Also, it executes another utility after modifying the environment as specified on the command line.
