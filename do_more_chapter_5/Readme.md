## Do More

### cd to the joe directory with one command.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:~ $ cd ~/temp/stuff/things/frank/joe/

### cd back to temp with one command, but not further above that.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:joe $ cd ../../../..

### Find out how to cd to your "home directory" with one command.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:learning_by_doing $ cd

### cd to your Documents directory, then find it with your GUI file browser (Finder, Windows Explorer, etc.).

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:~ $ cd ~/Documents/
 
### cd to your Downloads directory, then find it with your file browser.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:~ $ cd Downloads/

### Find another directory with your file browser, then cd to it.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:/ $ cd Users/nafetsremlap/Applications/

### Remember when you put quotes around a directory with spaces in it? You can do that with any command. For example, if you have a directory I Have Fun, then you can do: cd "I Have Fun"

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:learn_command_line_exercises $ cd "This has space"
