# Chapter 10: Copy a file (cp)

## Do More
> ***NOTE***: The answers for this chapter should not include the use of cd (change directory).

### Use the cp -r command to copy more directories with files in them.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ ls newplace/
    awesome.txt
    
    
    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ cp -r newplace randomplace
    
    
    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ ls randomplace/
    awesome.txt

### Copy a file to your home directory or desktop.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:~ $ cp Mi_tio_Cirilo-1.pdf Desktop/
    

### Find these files in your graphical user interface and open them in a text editor.

   Go to *Finder*, *nafetsremlap* under *Favorites*, *temp* folder where both the *newplace* and the *randomplace* folders can be found, and the *awesome.txt* document in both.

    
### Notice how sometimes I put a / (slash) at the end of a directory? That makes sure the file is really a directory, so if the directory doesn't exist I'll get an error.
