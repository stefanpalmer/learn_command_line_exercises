# Chapter 10: Copy a file (cp)

## Do More
> ***NOTE***: The answers for this chapter should not include the use of cd (change directory).

### Use the cp -r command to copy more directories with files in them.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:adirectory $ ls
    afile
    
    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ cp -r adirectory bdirectory
    
    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:bdirectory $ ls
    afile

### Copy a file to your home directory or desktop.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:~ $ cp Mi_tio_Cirilo-1.pdf Desktop/
    

### Find these files in your graphical user interface and open them in a text editor.

    
### Notice how sometimes I put a / (slash) at the end of a directory? That makes sure the file is really a directory, so if the directory doesn't exist I'll get an error.
