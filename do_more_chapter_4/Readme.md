## Do More

### The concept of a "path" might confuse you at this point. Don't worry. We'll do a lot more with them and then you'll get it.

### Make 20 other directories inside the temp directory in various levels. Go look at them with a graphical file browser.

### Make a directory with a space in the name by putting quotes around it
