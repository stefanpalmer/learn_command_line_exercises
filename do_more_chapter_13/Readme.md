# Chapter 13: Stream a file (cat)

## Do More

### Make a few more text files and work with cat.
    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ touch q.txt


    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ touch r.txt


    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ cat q.txt


    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ cat r.txt


    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ touch s.txt


    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ cat s.txt
    

### Unix: Try cat ex12.txt ex13.txt and see what it does.

   The text from both files is printed. First the text from ex12.txt and then the text from ex13.txt right after that.
