# Chapter 12: View a File (less, more)

## Do More

### Open your text file again and repeatedly copy-paste the text so that it's about 50-100 lines long.

   In ex12.txt

### Copy it to your temp directory again so you can look at it.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ less ex12.txt
    Some Stuff!Some Stuff!Some Stuff!
    Some Stuff!Some Stuff!Some Stuff!
    Some Stuff!Some Stuff!Some Stuff!
    Some Stuff!Some Stuff!Some Stuff!
    Some Stuff!Some Stuff!Some Stuff!
    ...
    
    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ more ex12.txt
    Some Stuff!Some Stuff!Some Stuff!
    Some Stuff!Some Stuff!Some Stuff!
    Some Stuff!Some Stuff!Some Stuff!
    Some Stuff!Some Stuff!Some Stuff!
    Some Stuff!Some Stuff!Some Stuff!
    ... 
    
    
    
### Now do the exercise again, but this time page through it. On Unix you use the spacebar and w (the letter w) to go down and up. Arrow keys also work. On Windows just hit spacebar to page through.

### Look at some of the empty files you created too.

    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ more uncool.txt
    
    Stefans-MacBook-Pro:temp $ less iamcool.txt
    iamcool.txt (END)
    
### The cp command will overwrite files that already exist so be careful copying files around.
